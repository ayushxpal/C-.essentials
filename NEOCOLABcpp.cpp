// Problem Statement



// Zara is developing a navigation system for a robot. The system uses directions to determine the robot's movement. So, implement a Navigator class that can receive direction input and provide corresponding navigation instructions.



// In this scenario, the program allows you to input a direction using integer values representing the cardinal directions (North, East, West, and South). The code then utilizes the Navigator class to determine the corresponding navigation instruction based on the input direction.



// Create an enum with all four directions: North, East, West, and South as the constants.



// We will then use the switch case statements to switch between the direction elements and print the output based on the value of the variable for the enum directions. Write a program to print the direction it is heading towards.

// Input format :
// The input consists of an integer representing the direction.

// Output format :
// The output prints whether the direction is North (or) South (or) East (or) West (or) Invalid Input.



// Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

// Code constraints :
// 1 represents North.

// 2 represents East.

// 3 represents West.

// 4 represents South.

// Sample test cases :
// Input 1 :
// 1
// Output 1 :
// We are headed towards North.
// Input 2 :
// 12
// Output 2 :
// Invalid Input
// Note :
// The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
// Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the failure of the test case.
